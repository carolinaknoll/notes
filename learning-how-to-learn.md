### 1. [Focused versus Diffuse Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/week/1)
Focused Mode is when you're concentrating temptly on something you're trying to learn.

Focused thinking is like a pinball machine.
Imagine **your brain like a pinball machine.** You release the thing and the as the ball bumps on the bumpers, it's like your brain making a thought path until it figures out an answer.
When you're figuring out things with your existing ideas, the pinball ball forms a path on the first bumpers, which are easier and nearest from it. But for thoughts that need new ideas, the bumpers are **down below, and are harder to reach.** We don't know how that pattern feels or to reach it. So **how to develop this?**
To get to these bumpers below, you need to **think differently**, and this is represented by the Diffuse thinking, which has widely dispersed bumps and a smaller number of them. With the **diffuse thinking you can look at things broadly, with a different perspective.**

> Dali used to have an interesting technique to help him come up with his fantastically creative Surrealist paintings. He'd relax in a chair and let his mind go free, often still vaguely thinking about what he had been previously focusing on. He'd have a key in his hand, dangling it just above the floor. And as he would slip into his dreams, falling asleep, the key would fall from his hand [SOUND] and the clatter would wake him up, just in time so he could gather up those diffuse mode connections and ideas in his mind. And off he'd go back into the focused mode bringing with him the new connections he'd made while in the diffuse mode.

When you're learning something, especially something hard, your mind needs to be able to go back and fourth between these two different learning modes.

> To gain muscular structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing your muscles to grow. Similarly, to build neuro-structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing yourself to grow a neuro-scaffold to hang your thinking on, a little bit every day and that's the trick.

We are only aware of a very small fraction of all of the activity in the brain, so we need to rely on brain imaging techniques to guide us.

Different areas of the brain are active during different activities.
Some areas are highly active when the subject interacts with the world, but turn off in a resting state.
Other areas are most active in the resting state and are called the default mode network. Other brain areas are also more active when you are resting, and these areas can be further divided into groups of areas that have common patterns of activity.

**We are not the same person we were before we went to sleep.**

Shakespeare makes an analogy with Macbeth:

> Sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care, the death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast.

With this, Shakespeare is making an analogy between knitted clothes and sleep that knits up the loose threads of experience and concerns during the day and weaves them into the tapestry of your life story.
