### 1. Focused versus Diffuse Thinking
Focused Mode is when you're concentrating temptly on something you're trying to learn.

Focused thinking is like a pinball machine.
Imagine **your brain like a pinball machine.** You release the thing and the as the ball bumps on the bumpers, it's like your brain making a thought path until it figures out an answer.
When you're figuring out things with your existing ideas, the pinball ball forms a path on the first bumpers, which are easier and nearest from it. But for thoughts that need new ideas, the bumpers are **down below, and are harder to reach.** We don't know how that pattern feels or to reach it. So **how to develop this?**
To get to these bumpers below, you need to **think differently**, and this is represented by the Diffuse thinking, which has widely dispersed bumps and a smaller number of them. With the **diffuse thinking you can look at things broadly, with a different perspective.**

![Pinball Analogy - Focused vs Diffuse thinking](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d24685eb74b4f91f25ffcfc4ca0322dd-c "Pinball Analogy - Focused vs Diffuse thinking")

> Dali used to have an interesting technique to help him come up with his fantastically creative Surrealist paintings. He'd relax in a chair and let his mind go free, often still vaguely thinking about what he had been previously focusing on. He'd have a key in his hand, dangling it just above the floor. And as he would slip into his dreams, falling asleep, the key would fall from his hand [SOUND] and the clatter would wake him up, just in time so he could gather up those diffuse mode connections and ideas in his mind. And off he'd go back into the focused mode bringing with him the new connections he'd made while in the diffuse mode.

When you're learning something, especially something hard, your mind needs to be able to go back and fourth between these two different learning modes.

> To gain muscular structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing your muscles to grow. Similarly, to build neuro-structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing yourself to grow a neuro-scaffold to hang your thinking on, a little bit every day and that's the trick.

We are only aware of a very small fraction of all of the activity in the brain, so we need to rely on brain imaging techniques to guide us.

Different areas of the brain are active during different activities.
Some areas are highly active when the subject interacts with the world, but turn off in a resting state.
Other areas are most active in the resting state and are called the default mode network. Other brain areas are also more active when you are resting, and these areas can be further divided into groups of areas that have common patterns of activity.

**We are not the same person we were before we went to sleep.**

Shakespeare makes an analogy with Macbeth:

> Sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care, the death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast.

With this, Shakespeare is making an analogy between knitted clothes and sleep that knits up the loose threads of experience and concerns during the day and weaves them into the tapestry of your life story.

### 2. Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

When you look at something that you really rather not do, it seems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with pain. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else. But here's the trick. Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like, that neurodiscomfort disappeared.

> So it seems what happens when you procrastinate is something like this: first, you observe, and get a cue about something that causes a tiny bit of unease. You don't like it, so to make the sensation go away you turn your attention from whatever caused that unease.

You turn toward something more pleasant. The result, you feel happier, temporarily.

If you have the word cow, you can point right to a cow to learn what that word means. But for mathematical ideas, there's often no analogous thing that you can point to. There are no plus signs standing out in a field. No multiplication, division, or other kinds of things that can directly equate to mini mathematical or scientific terms. These terms are more abstract, in other words.

Well, you might say, yeah, but what about ones like love, zest, or hope? Those are all abstract. Yes they are, but the thing is, these abstract terms are often related to our emotions. We can feel our emotions, even if we can't see and point to concrete examples, like we could with the cow.

This means it's important to practice with ideas and concepts you're learning in math and science, just like anything else you're learning. to help enhance and strengthen the neural connection your making during the learning process. On a tought pattern, neurons become linked together through repeated use. **The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you.** Even if the ideas you're dealing with are abstract, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete. At least they are if you build and strengthen them through practice.

When you first begin to understand something, the neural pattern from is there, but very weak. When you solve the problem again fresh from the start, without looking at the solution, you begin deepening that neuron pattern, making it darker. And when you have the problem down cold, so you can go over each step completely and concisely in your mind without even looking at the solution, and you've even had practice on related problems, the pattern is like a dark firm pattern. **Practice makes permanent.**

When you're learning, what you want to do is study something. Study it hard by focusing intently. Then take a break or at least change your focus to something different for awhile. During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. **Your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry.** If you don't do this, if instead you learn by cramming, your knowledge base will look all in a jumble with everything confused, a poor foundation. If you have problems with procrastination, that's when you want to use the Pomodoro, that brief timer. This helps you get going, using brief periods each day of focused attention, that will help you start building the neural patterns you need to be more successful in learning more challenging materials.

Working memory vs Long tem memory.

**Working memory is like a inefficient mental black board.** It's the part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind. We tend to automatically group memory items in to chunks so it seems our working memory is bigger than it actually is. Although your working memory is like a blackboard, it's not a very good blackboard. You often need to keep repeating what you are trying to work with so it's stays in your working memory.

**Long term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.** When you encounter something new, you often use your working memory to handle it. If you want to move that information into your long term memory, it often takes time and practice.

To help with this process, use a technique called **spaced repetition.** This technique involves **repeating what you're trying to retain,** but what you want to do is space this repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique, for example, over a number of days. Extending your practice over several days does make a difference.

Research has shown that if you try to glue things into your memory by repeating something 20 times in one evening, for example, it won't stick nearly as well as if you practice it the same number of times over several days. This is like building the brick wall we saw earlier. If you don't leave time for the mortar to dry, that is, time for the synoptic connections to form and strengthen, you won't have a very good structure.

**Sleep helps your brain wash away the toxins that are formed in your brain during the day. It is important to have enough sleep.**

> But sleep does more than just allow your brain to wash away toxins. It's actually important part of the memory and learning process. It's seems that during sleep your brain tidies up ideas and concepts your thinking about and learning. It erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember. During sleep your brain also rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them.

> Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn. It's as if the complete deactivation of the conscious you in the pre-frontal cortex at the forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking more easily to one another, allowing them to put together the neural solution to your learning task while you're sleeping. Of course, you must also plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work.

It is good to have some time to switch to using your muscles rather than your brain. To be able to process that information and to get the neurons working on it.

It is also good to be able to be in an enriched environment.

If you have a rat, and you give it an enriched environment in which the rat is able to move around, and do things, and interact with other rats, the strengths of the connections between the neurons is much stronger. It can be made by a factor of two, much stronger than in a rat that has been kept in a cage where there is impoverished environment.

### Week 2 - Chunking

### What is a Chunk?
When you first look at a new concept it sometimes doesn't make much sense, it might look like jumbled puzzle pieces.
Just memorizing a fact without understanding or context doesn't help you understand what's really going on or how the concept fits together with other concepts you're learning: there are no interlocking puzzle edges on the puzzle piece to help you fit it to other pieces.

**Chunking is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning.**

We talked earlier about working memory and how those four slots of working memory appear to hang out in the part of your brain right behind your forehead known as the prefrontal cortex. When you're focusing your attention on something it's almost as if you have an octopus. **The octopus of attention that slips it's tentacles through those four slots of working memory when necessary to help you make connections to information that you might have in various parts of your brain.**

This is different from the random connections of the diffuse mode. Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning. It is also often what helps get you started in creating a chunk. *Interestingly when you're stressed your attentional octopus begins to lose the ability to make some of those connections. This is why your brain doesn't seem to work right when you're angry, stressed, or afraid.*

Chunks are pieces of information, through bound together through meaning or use. You can take the letters P-O and P and bind them together into one conceptual easy to remember chunk, the word pop. Underneath that single pop chunk is a symphony of neurons that have learned to sing in tune with one another. The complex neural activity that ties together our simplifying abstract chunks of thought.

The best programs for learning language incorporate structured practice that includes repetition and rote focus mode learning of the language along with more diffuse-like free speech with native speakers. The goal is to embed the basic words and patterns so you can speak as freely and creatively in your new language as you do in your native language. As it turns out one of the first steps towards gaining expertise in academic topics is to create conceptual chunks, mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning.

Basically, a chunk means a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively. **Focused practice and repetition, the creation of strong memory traces, helps you to create chunks.** Practice and repetition in building chunks aren't all you need to become a truly creative master of the material you're learning.

Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you don't know need to remember all the little underlying details. You've got the main idea, the chunk, and that's enough.

It's like getting dressed in the morning. You just think one simple thought like, I'll get dressed, but it's amazing when you realize the complex swirl of underlying activities that take place with that one, simple chunk of thought.

#### How to form a chunk?
If you're learning to play a difficult song on the guitar, the neural representation of the song in your mind can be considered as a rather large chunk. You would first listen to the song. Maybe you'd even watch someone else playing the song especially if you were just a beginner who was learning things like, how to hold the guitar.

Getting an initial sense of the pattern you want to master for yourself is similar for most subjects or skills. You often have to grasp little bits of songs that become neuro mini-chunks, which will later join together into larger chunks. For example, over several days, you might learn how to smoothly place the musical passages on a guitar, and when you've grasped those passages, you could join them together with other passages that you've learned, gradually putting everything together so you can play the song.

*The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained, that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together.*

Learning in math and science involves the same approach. When you're learning new math and science material, you're often given sample problems with worked out solutions. This is because, when you're first trying to understand how to work a problem, you have a heavy cognitive load. So it helps to start out with a work through example. It's like first listening to a song before trying to play the song yourself. Most of the details of the work out solution are right there, and your job is simply to figure out why the steps are taken the way they are. They can help you see the key features, and underline principles of a problem.

This approach is not just a cookie-cutter, just-do-as-you're told, mindless approach when following a worked-out solution. It's more like using a road map to help you when traveling to a new place.

The first step on chunking is simply to **focus your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk.**

If you had the television going on in the background, or you're looking up every few minutes to check or answer your phone or computer messages, it means you're going to have more difficulty in making a chunk, because your brain is not really focusing on chunking the new material.

When you first begin to learn something, you're making new neural patterns and connecting them with preexisting patterns that are spread through many areas of the brain. Your octopus tentacles, so to speak, can't reach very well if some of them are off on other thoughts using up some of the limited slots in your working memory.

The second step in chunking is to understand the basic idea you're trying to chunk, whether it's understanding a concept such as continental drift, seeing the connection between the basic elements of the plot for a story, grasping the economic principle of supply and demand, or comprehending the essence of a particular type of math problem.

> Students can often synthesize the gist, that is figure out the main idea or ideas, pretty naturally. Or at least they can grasp those ideas if they allow the focused and diffuse modes of thinking to take turns in helping them figure out what's going on. **Understanding is like a superglue that helps hold the underlying memory traces together.** It creates broad encompassing traces that can link to other memory traces. *Can you create a chunk if you don't understand? Yes, but it's often a useless chunk that won't fit in with, or relate to other material of your learning.*

Just understanding how a problem was solved does not necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later. Don't confuse the "Aha!", of a breakthrough in understanding, with solid expertise. That's part of why you can grasp an idea when a teacher presents it in class, but if you don't review it fairly soon after you first learned it, it can seem incomprehensible when it comes time to prepare for a test.

In math and science related subjects, closing the book and testing yourself on whether you, yourself, can solve the problem you think you understand, will speed up your learning at this stage. **You often realize the first time you actually understand something is when you can actually do it yourself.**

> Learning takes place in two ways. There's a bottom up chunking process, where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily access it whenever you need to. And there's also a sort of a top down big picture process that allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in.

Doing a rapid two-minute picture walk through a chapter in a book before you begin studying it, glancing at pictures and section headings, can allow you to gain a sense of the big picture. So can listening to a very well organized lecture. These kinds of activities can help you know where to put the chunks you're constructing, how the chunks relate to one another, just like having different groups of puzzle pieces put together separately.

Learn the major concepts or points first. These are often the key parts of a good instructor or book chapter's outline, flow charts, tables, or concept maps. Once you have this done,fill in the details. Even if a few of the puzzle pieces are missing at the end of your studies, you can still see the big picture.

### Illusions of Competence
One of the most common approaches for trying to learn material from a book or from notes is simply to reread it. But psychologist Jeffrey Karpicke has shown that this approach is actually much less productive than another, very simple, technique. Recall. After you've read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you've just read.

Students studied a scientific text and then practiced it, by recalling as much of the information as they could. Then they re-studied the text and recalled it again. That is, they tried to remember the key ideas, once more. The results, in the same amount of time, by simply practising and recalling the material students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach.

When we retrieve knowledge, we're not just being mindless robots. The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning, and helps us to begin forming chunks. It's almost as if the recall process helps build in little neural hooks, that we can hang our thinking on.

Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make your study time more focused and effective. The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading, so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition.

There are four or so slots, in working memory. When you're first learning how to understand a concept, or technique to solve a problem, your entire working memory is involved in the process. As you begin to chunk the concept, you will feel it connecting more easily and smoothly in your mind. Once the concept is chunked, it takes up only one slot in working memory. It simultaneously becomes one smooth strand that's easy to follow, and to use to make new connections.

The rest of your working memory is left clear. That dangling strand of chunked material has, in some sense, increased the amount of information available to your working memory. It's as if the slot in working memory is a hyperlink that's been connected to a great big web page.

Illusions of competence in learning: the reason students like to keep rereading their notes or a textbook is that when they have the book or Google open right in front of them, it provides the illusion that the material is also in their brains. But it's not, because it can be easier to look at the book instead of recalling, students persist in their illusions studying in a way that just isn't very effective.

Just wanting to learn the material, and spending a lot of time with it, doesn't guarantee you'll actually learn it. A super helpful way to make sure you're learning and not fooling yourself with illusions of competence, is to test yourself on whatever you're learning.
In some sense, that's what recall is actually doing. Allowing you to see whether or not you really grasp an idea.

If you make a mistake in what you are doing, it's actually a very good thing. You want to try not to repeat your mistakes, of course, but mistakes are very valuable to make in your little self tests before high stakes real tests. Because they allow you to make repairs and you're thinking flaws bit by bit mistakes help correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and do better.

Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material. When you are learning something new you can often take in subliminal cues for the room and the space around you at the time you were originally learning the material. This can throw you off when you take tests because you often take tests in a room that's different from the room you were learning in. By recalling and thinking about the material when you are in various physical environment, you become independent of the cues from any one given location. That helps you avoid the problem of the test room being different from where you originally learned the material.

### Part two - Seeing the Bigger Picture
### What motivates you?
Learning is hard when you're not into it. But it's way easier when you're learning something you like. And that's why:

Most of the neurons in your cortex carry information about what is happening around you and what you're doing. Neuromodulators are chemicals that influence how a neurons responds to other neurons. There are three important: **Acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin**.

**Acetylcholine neurons form neuromodulatory connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning, when you are paying close attention.** They project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity, leading to new long term memory. Neuromodulators also have a profound impact on your unconscious mind. One of the great brain discoveries in my lifetime has been that our motivation is controlled by a particular chemical substance called Dopamine. Which is found in a small set of neurons in our brain stem.

**Dopamine is released from these neurons, when we receive an unexpected reward.** It's signals project widely and have a very powerful effect on learning. And this is something that also affects decision making. And even the value of sensory inputs.
Dopamine is in the business of predicting future rewards and not just the immediate reward. This can motivate you to do something that may not be rewarding right now but will lead to a much better reward in the future.

Addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity and fool your brain into thinking that something wonderful has just happened.
In fact just the opposite has just happened. This leads to craving and dependence, which can hijack your free will and can motivate actions that are harmful to you.
Loss of Dopamine neurons leads to a lack of motivation. And something called anhedonia, which is a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure.

When you promise to treat yourself something after a study section you are tapping into your dopamine system.

**Serotonin strongly affects your social life. In monkey troops the alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity and the lowest ranking male has the lowest levels.** Prozac, which is prescribed for clinical depression, raises the level of Serotonin activity.

**The level of Serotonin is also closely linked to risk taking behavior. With higher risk in lower Serotonin monkeys.**
Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society.

Finally your emotions strongly affect learning as you are well aware. Emotions were once thought to be separate from cognition but recent research has shown that emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and interact with learning and memory.

The amygdala is part of the limbic system which together with hippocampus is involved in processing memory and decision making as well as regulating emotional reactions. You will want to keep your amygdala happy to be an effective learner.
***

### The value of a library of chunks
What people do to enhance their knowledge and gain expertise is to gradually build the number of chunks in their mind. Valuable bits of information, they can piece together in new and creative ways. Chess masters, for example, can easily access thousands of different chess patterns. The bigger and more well practiced your chunked mental library, whatever the subject you're learning, the more easily you'll be able to solve problems and figure out solutions.

Chunks can also help you understand new concepts. This is because when you grasp one chunk, you'll find that that chunk can be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, not only in that field, but also in very different fields. This idea is called transfer. For example, concepts and problems solving methods you learned for physics can be very similar to chunked concepts in business.

**When you're trying to figure something out, if you have a good library of these chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution by metaphorically speaking, listening to whispers from your diffuse mode. Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novel problems.**

In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize not only a specific concept, but different types and classes of concepts so that you can automatically know how to solve quickly or handle whatever you encounter. You'll start to see patterns that simplify problem solving for you and will soon find that different solution techniques are lurking at the edge of your memory.

There are two ways to figure something out or to solve problems. First there's *sequential step by step reasoning*, and second *through a more holistic intuition*.

**Sequential thinking**, where each **small step** leads deliberately towards a solution, involves the **focused mode**.

**Intuition** on the other hand often seems to **require this creative diffuse mode linking** of several **seemingly different focused mode thoughts**.

Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition, because these new ideas make a leap away from what you're familiar with. Keep in mind that the diffuse mode's semi random way of making connections means that the solutions they provide should be very carefully verified using the focused mode. Intuitive insights aren't always correct.

You may think there are so many problems and concepts, just in a single section or chapter of whatever you're studying, there's just no way to learn them all.

This is where the law of serendipity comes into play. Lady luck favors the one who tries. Just focus on whatever section you're studying. You'll find that once you put that first problem or concept in your mental library, whatever it is, then the second concept will go in a little more easily. And the third more easily still. Not that all of this is a snap, but it does get easier.
***

### Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung and Interleaving

When you're learning a new idea, you sometimes tend to practice it over and over again during the same study session. Continuing to study or practice after you've mastered what you can in the session is called *overlearning*.

Overleaning can have its place. It can produce an automaticity that can be important when you're executing a serve in tennis or a perfect piano concerto. If you choke on tests or public speaking, overlearning can be especially valuable. Did you know that even expert public speakers practice on the order of 70 hours for a typical 20-minute TED Talk? Automaticity can indeed be helpful in times of nervousness, but be wary of repetitive overlearning during a single session. Research has shown it can be a waste of valuable learning time.

Once you've got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn't strengthen the kinds of long term memory connections you want to have strengthened.

> Using a subsequent study session to repeat what you're trying to learn is just fine and often valuable. It can strengthen and deepen your chunked neuron patterns. But be wary; repeating something you already know perfectly well, is, face it, easy. It can also bring the illusion of competence that you've mastered the full range of material, when you've actually only mastered the easy stuff. Instead, you want to balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult. This focusing on the more difficult material is called *deliberate practice*.

All this is also related to a concept known as *Einstellung*.

In this phenomenon, your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern you've already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found. We saw this in the focus pinball picture, where your initial pinball of thought went to the upper part of the brain, but the solution thought pattern was in the lower part.

**The crowded bumpers of the focus mode and the previous patterns you built can create a sort of rut that prevents you from springing to a new place where the solution might be found.** Einstellung means mindset. Basically you can remember einstellung as installing a roadblock because of the way you were initially looking at something. This kind of wrong approach is especially easy to do because sometimes your initial intuition about what's happening or what you need to be doing is misleading. **You have to unlearn your erroneous older ideas or approaches even while you're learning new ones.**

One significant mistake students sometimes make in learning is they blindly start working on homework without reading the text book, attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or even speaking with someone knowledgeable. This is a recipe for sinking. Mastering a new subject means learning not only the basic chunks, but also learning how to select and use different chunks. The best way to learn that is by practicing **jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies.** This is called **interleaving**.

Once you have the basic idea of the technique down during your study session, sort of like learning to ride a bike with training wheels, start interleaving your practice with problems of different types or different types of approaches, concepts, procedures.

Do what you can to mix up your learning. You want your brain to become used to the idea that just knowing how to use a particular concept, approach, or problem-solving technique isn't enough. You also need to know when to use it.

Interleaving your studies, making it a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through problems in the different chapters and materials can sometimes seem to make your learning a little more difficult, but in reality, it helps you learn more deeply.

Interleaving is extraordinarily important. Although practice and repetition is important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it's interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity. It's where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently.

When you interleave within one subject or one discipline, you begin to develop your creative power within that discipline. When you interleave between several subjects or disciplines, you can more easily make interesting new connections between chunks in the different fields, which can enhance your creativity even further.

> Of course it takes time to develop solid chunks of knowledge in different fields, so sometimes there's a trade off. Developing expertise in several fields means you can bring very new ideas from one field to the other, but it can also mean that your expertise in one field or the other isn't quite as deep as that of the person who specializes in only one discipline. On the other hand, if you develop expertise in only one discipline, you may know it very deeply but you may become more deeply entrenched in your familiar way of thinking and not be able to handle new ideas.

Finally, don't make the mistake of thinking that learning only occurs in the kinds of subjects you acquire from teachers or books. When you teach a child how to deal effectively with a bully, or you fix a leaky faucet, or you quickly pack a small suitcase for a business trip to Hong Kong, all of these illustrate the outcomes of important aspects of learning.

### Summary

**Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through use and often through meaning.** You can think of a chunk as a scintillating network of neurons that compactly synthesizes key ideas or actions. Chunks can get bigger and more complex. But at the same time, they're a single easy to access item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory. Chunks are best built with focused, undivided attention, understanding of the basic idea. And practice to help deepen your patterns and to help you gain big picture context.

**Simple recall, trying to remember the key points without looking at the page,** is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along. It seems to help build neural hooks. They help you better understand the material. Also try recalling material in places that are different from where you originally learned the material, so it becomes more deeply ingrained and accessible, regardless of what room you're in. This can be very helpful for tests.

**Transfer is the idea that a chunk you've mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities.** Interleave your learning by practicing your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session. Chunks are very important, but they don't necessarily build flexibility, which is also important in becoming an expert with the material you're learning.

Illusions of competence in learning. **Learn to recognize when you're fooling yourself about whether you're actually learning the material. Test yourself frequently.** Using little mini-tests to see whether you're actually learning the material, or whether you've been fooling yourself, thinking you're learning when you're actually not. Recall is actually a form of mini-testing. Try to avoid depending too much on highlighting, which can fool you into thinking that the material is going into your brain when it actually isn't. Mistakes are a good thing to make when you're learning. They allow you to catch illusions of competence.

Avoid practicing only the easy stuff, which can bring the illusion that you've mastered the material. Deliberately practice what you find more difficult to gain full mastery of the material.

**Einstellung is when your initial thought, an idea you've already had in mind, or a neural pattern you've already developed well and strengthened, prevents a better idea or solution from being found.** Or keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new, better, or more appropriate solutions. The Law of Serendipity is helpful. Lady Luck favors the one who tries. Just pick one tiny thing out to learn, then another.
