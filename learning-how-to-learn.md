### 1. Focused versus Diffuse Thinking
Focused Mode is when you're concentrating temptly on something you're trying to learn.

Focused thinking is like a pinball machine.
Imagine **your brain like a pinball machine.** You release the thing and the as the ball bumps on the bumpers, it's like your brain making a thought path until it figures out an answer.
When you're figuring out things with your existing ideas, the pinball ball forms a path on the first bumpers, which are easier and nearest from it. But for thoughts that need new ideas, the bumpers are **down below, and are harder to reach.** We don't know how that pattern feels or to reach it. So **how to develop this?**
To get to these bumpers below, you need to **think differently**, and this is represented by the Diffuse thinking, which has widely dispersed bumps and a smaller number of them. With the **diffuse thinking you can look at things broadly, with a different perspective.**

> Dali used to have an interesting technique to help him come up with his fantastically creative Surrealist paintings. He'd relax in a chair and let his mind go free, often still vaguely thinking about what he had been previously focusing on. He'd have a key in his hand, dangling it just above the floor. And as he would slip into his dreams, falling asleep, the key would fall from his hand [SOUND] and the clatter would wake him up, just in time so he could gather up those diffuse mode connections and ideas in his mind. And off he'd go back into the focused mode bringing with him the new connections he'd made while in the diffuse mode.

When you're learning something, especially something hard, your mind needs to be able to go back and fourth between these two different learning modes.

> To gain muscular structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing your muscles to grow. Similarly, to build neuro-structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing yourself to grow a neuro-scaffold to hang your thinking on, a little bit every day and that's the trick.

We are only aware of a very small fraction of all of the activity in the brain, so we need to rely on brain imaging techniques to guide us.

Different areas of the brain are active during different activities.
Some areas are highly active when the subject interacts with the world, but turn off in a resting state.
Other areas are most active in the resting state and are called the default mode network. Other brain areas are also more active when you are resting, and these areas can be further divided into groups of areas that have common patterns of activity.

**We are not the same person we were before we went to sleep.**

Shakespeare makes an analogy with Macbeth:

> Sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care, the death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast.

With this, Shakespeare is making an analogy between knitted clothes and sleep that knits up the loose threads of experience and concerns during the day and weaves them into the tapestry of your life story.

### 2. Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

When you look at something that you really rather not do, it seems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with pain. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else. But here's the trick. Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like, that neurodiscomfort disappeared.

> So it seems what happens when you procrastinate is something like this: first, you observe, and get a cue about something that causes a tiny bit of unease. You don't like it, so to make the sensation go away you turn your attention from whatever caused that unease.

You turn toward something more pleasant. The result, you feel happier, temporarily.

If you have the word cow, you can point right to a cow to learn what that word means. But for mathematical ideas, there's often no analogous thing that you can point to. There are no plus signs standing out in a field. No multiplication, division, or other kinds of things that can directly equate to mini mathematical or scientific terms. These terms are more abstract, in other words.

Well, you might say, yeah, but what about ones like love, zest, or hope? Those are all abstract. Yes they are, but the thing is, these abstract terms are often related to our emotions. We can feel our emotions, even if we can't see and point to concrete examples, like we could with the cow.

This means it's important to practice with ideas and concepts you're learning in math and science, just like anything else you're learning. to help enhance and strengthen the neural connection your making during the learning process. On a tought pattern, neurons become linked together through repeated use. **The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you.** Even if the ideas you're dealing with are abstract, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete. At least they are if you build and strengthen them through practice.

When you first begin to understand something, the neural pattern from is there, but very weak. When you solve the problem again fresh from the start, without looking at the solution, you begin deepening that neuron pattern, making it darker. And when you have the problem down cold, so you can go over each step completely and concisely in your mind without even looking at the solution, and you've even had practice on related problems, the pattern is like a dark firm pattern. **Practice makes permanent.**

When you're learning, what you want to do is study something. Study it hard by focusing intently. Then take a break or at least change your focus to something different for awhile. During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. **Your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry.** If you don't do this, if instead you learn by cramming, your knowledge base will look all in a jumble with everything confused, a poor foundation. If you have problems with procrastination, that's when you want to use the Pomodoro, that brief timer. This helps you get going, using brief periods each day of focused attention, that will help you start building the neural patterns you need to be more successful in learning more challenging materials.

Working memory vs Long tem memory.

**Working memory is like a inefficient mental black board.** It's the part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind. We tend to automatically group memory items in to chunks so it seems our working memory is bigger than it actually is. Although your working memory is like a blackboard, it's not a very good blackboard. You often need to keep repeating what you are trying to work with so it's stays in your working memory.

**Long term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.** When you encounter something new, you often use your working memory to handle it. If you want to move that information into your long term memory, it often takes time and practice.

To help with this process, use a technique called **spaced repetition.** This technique involves **repeating what you're trying to retain,** but what you want to do is space this repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique, for example, over a number of days. Extending your practice over several days does make a difference.

Research has shown that if you try to glue things into your memory by repeating something 20 times in one evening, for example, it won't stick nearly as well as if you practice it the same number of times over several days. This is like building the brick wall we saw earlier. If you don't leave time for the mortar to dry, that is, time for the synoptic connections to form and strengthen, you won't have a very good structure.

**Sleep helps your brain wash away the toxins that are formed in your brain during the day. It is important to have enough sleep.**

> But sleep does more than just allow your brain to wash away toxins. It's actually important part of the memory and learning process. It's seems that during sleep your brain tidies up ideas and concepts your thinking about and learning. It erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember. During sleep your brain also rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them.

> Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn. It's as if the complete deactivation of the conscious you in the pre-frontal cortex at the forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking more easily to one another, allowing them to put together the neural solution to your learning task while you're sleeping. Of course, you must also plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work.

It is good to have some time to switch to using your muscles rather than your brain. To be able to process that information and to get the neurons working on it.

It is also good to be able to be in an enriched environment.

If you have a rat, and you give it an enriched environment in which the rat is able to move around, and do things, and interact with other rats, the strengths of the connections between the neurons is much stronger. It can be made by a factor of two, much stronger than in a rat that has been kept in a cage where there is impoverished environment.
