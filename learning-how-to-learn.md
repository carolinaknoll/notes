### 1. Focused versus Diffuse Thinking
Focused Mode is when you're concentrating temptly on something you're trying to learn.

Focused thinking is like a pinball machine.
Imagine **your brain like a pinball machine.** You release the thing and the as the ball bumps on the bumpers, it's like your brain making a thought path until it figures out an answer.
When you're figuring out things with your existing ideas, the pinball ball forms a path on the first bumpers, which are easier and nearest from it. But for thoughts that need new ideas, the bumpers are **down below, and are harder to reach.** We don't know how that pattern feels or to reach it. So **how to develop this?**
To get to these bumpers below, you need to **think differently**, and this is represented by the Diffuse thinking, which has widely dispersed bumps and a smaller number of them. With the **diffuse thinking you can look at things broadly, with a different perspective.**

![Pinball Analogy - Focused vs Diffuse thinking](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d24685eb74b4f91f25ffcfc4ca0322dd-c "Pinball Analogy - Focused vs Diffuse thinking")

> Dali used to have an interesting technique to help him come up with his fantastically creative Surrealist paintings. He'd relax in a chair and let his mind go free, often still vaguely thinking about what he had been previously focusing on. He'd have a key in his hand, dangling it just above the floor. And as he would slip into his dreams, falling asleep, the key would fall from his hand [SOUND] and the clatter would wake him up, just in time so he could gather up those diffuse mode connections and ideas in his mind. And off he'd go back into the focused mode bringing with him the new connections he'd made while in the diffuse mode.

When you're learning something, especially something hard, your mind needs to be able to go back and fourth between these two different learning modes.

> To gain muscular structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing your muscles to grow. Similarly, to build neuro-structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing yourself to grow a neuro-scaffold to hang your thinking on, a little bit every day and that's the trick.

We are only aware of a very small fraction of all of the activity in the brain, so we need to rely on brain imaging techniques to guide us.

Different areas of the brain are active during different activities.
Some areas are highly active when the subject interacts with the world, but turn off in a resting state.
Other areas are most active in the resting state and are called the default mode network. Other brain areas are also more active when you are resting, and these areas can be further divided into groups of areas that have common patterns of activity.

**We are not the same person we were before we went to sleep.**

Shakespeare makes an analogy with Macbeth:

> Sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care, the death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast.

With this, Shakespeare is making an analogy between knitted clothes and sleep that knits up the loose threads of experience and concerns during the day and weaves them into the tapestry of your life story.

### 2. Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

When you look at something that you really rather not do, it seems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with pain. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else. But here's the trick. Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like, that neurodiscomfort disappeared.

> So it seems what happens when you procrastinate is something like this: first, you observe, and get a cue about something that causes a tiny bit of unease. You don't like it, so to make the sensation go away you turn your attention from whatever caused that unease.

You turn toward something more pleasant. The result, you feel happier, temporarily.

If you have the word cow, you can point right to a cow to learn what that word means. But for mathematical ideas, there's often no analogous thing that you can point to. There are no plus signs standing out in a field. No multiplication, division, or other kinds of things that can directly equate to mini mathematical or scientific terms. These terms are more abstract, in other words.

Well, you might say, yeah, but what about ones like love, zest, or hope? Those are all abstract. Yes they are, but the thing is, these abstract terms are often related to our emotions. We can feel our emotions, even if we can't see and point to concrete examples, like we could with the cow.

This means it's important to practice with ideas and concepts you're learning in math and science, just like anything else you're learning. to help enhance and strengthen the neural connection your making during the learning process. On a tought pattern, neurons become linked together through repeated use. **The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you.** Even if the ideas you're dealing with are abstract, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete. At least they are if you build and strengthen them through practice.

When you first begin to understand something, the neural pattern from is there, but very weak. When you solve the problem again fresh from the start, without looking at the solution, you begin deepening that neuron pattern, making it darker. And when you have the problem down cold, so you can go over each step completely and concisely in your mind without even looking at the solution, and you've even had practice on related problems, the pattern is like a dark firm pattern. **Practice makes permanent.**

When you're learning, what you want to do is study something. Study it hard by focusing intently. Then take a break or at least change your focus to something different for awhile. During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. **Your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry.** If you don't do this, if instead you learn by cramming, your knowledge base will look all in a jumble with everything confused, a poor foundation. If you have problems with procrastination, that's when you want to use the Pomodoro, that brief timer. This helps you get going, using brief periods each day of focused attention, that will help you start building the neural patterns you need to be more successful in learning more challenging materials.

Working memory vs Long tem memory.

**Working memory is like a inefficient mental black board.** It's the part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind. We tend to automatically group memory items in to chunks so it seems our working memory is bigger than it actually is. Although your working memory is like a blackboard, it's not a very good blackboard. You often need to keep repeating what you are trying to work with so it's stays in your working memory.

**Long term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.** When you encounter something new, you often use your working memory to handle it. If you want to move that information into your long term memory, it often takes time and practice.

To help with this process, use a technique called **spaced repetition.** This technique involves **repeating what you're trying to retain,** but what you want to do is space this repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique, for example, over a number of days. Extending your practice over several days does make a difference.

Research has shown that if you try to glue things into your memory by repeating something 20 times in one evening, for example, it won't stick nearly as well as if you practice it the same number of times over several days. This is like building the brick wall we saw earlier. If you don't leave time for the mortar to dry, that is, time for the synoptic connections to form and strengthen, you won't have a very good structure.

**Sleep helps your brain wash away the toxins that are formed in your brain during the day. It is important to have enough sleep.**

> But sleep does more than just allow your brain to wash away toxins. It's actually important part of the memory and learning process. It's seems that during sleep your brain tidies up ideas and concepts your thinking about and learning. It erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember. During sleep your brain also rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them.

> Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn. It's as if the complete deactivation of the conscious you in the pre-frontal cortex at the forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking more easily to one another, allowing them to put together the neural solution to your learning task while you're sleeping. Of course, you must also plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work.

It is good to have some time to switch to using your muscles rather than your brain. To be able to process that information and to get the neurons working on it.

It is also good to be able to be in an enriched environment.

If you have a rat, and you give it an enriched environment in which the rat is able to move around, and do things, and interact with other rats, the strengths of the connections between the neurons is much stronger. It can be made by a factor of two, much stronger than in a rat that has been kept in a cage where there is impoverished environment.

### Week 2 - Chunking

### What is a Chunk?
When you first look at a new concept it sometimes doesn't make much sense, it might look like jumbled puzzle pieces.
Just memorizing a fact without understanding or context doesn't help you understand what's really going on or how the concept fits together with other concepts you're learning: there are no interlocking puzzle edges on the puzzle piece to help you fit it to other pieces.

**Chunking is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning.**

We talked earlier about working memory and how those four slots of working memory appear to hang out in the part of your brain right behind your forehead known as the prefrontal cortex. When you're focusing your attention on something it's almost as if you have an octopus. **The octopus of attention that slips it's tentacles through those four slots of working memory when necessary to help you make connections to information that you might have in various parts of your brain.**

This is different from the random connections of the diffuse mode. Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning. It is also often what helps get you started in creating a chunk. *Interestingly when you're stressed your attentional octopus begins to lose the ability to make some of those connections. This is why your brain doesn't seem to work right when you're angry, stressed, or afraid.*

Chunks are pieces of information, through bound together through meaning or use. You can take the letters P-O and P and bind them together into one conceptual easy to remember chunk, the word pop. Underneath that single pop chunk is a symphony of neurons that have learned to sing in tune with one another. The complex neural activity that ties together our simplifying abstract chunks of thought.

The best programs for learning language incorporate structured practice that includes repetition and rote focus mode learning of the language along with more diffuse-like free speech with native speakers. The goal is to embed the basic words and patterns so you can speak as freely and creatively in your new language as you do in your native language. As it turns out one of the first steps towards gaining expertise in academic topics is to create conceptual chunks, mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning.

Basically, a chunk means a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively. **Focused practice and repetition, the creation of strong memory traces, helps you to create chunks.** Practice and repetition in building chunks aren't all you need to become a truly creative master of the material you're learning.

Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you don't know need to remember all the little underlying details. You've got the main idea, the chunk, and that's enough.

It's like getting dressed in the morning. You just think one simple thought like, I'll get dressed, but it's amazing when you realize the complex swirl of underlying activities that take place with that one, simple chunk of thought.

#### How to form a chunk?
If you're learning to play a difficult song on the guitar, the neural representation of the song in your mind can be considered as a rather large chunk. You would first listen to the song. Maybe you'd even watch someone else playing the song especially if you were just a beginner who was learning things like, how to hold the guitar.

Getting an initial sense of the pattern you want to master for yourself is similar for most subjects or skills. You often have to grasp little bits of songs that become neuro mini-chunks, which will later join together into larger chunks. For example, over several days, you might learn how to smoothly place the musical passages on a guitar, and when you've grasped those passages, you could join them together with other passages that you've learned, gradually putting everything together so you can play the song.

*The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained, that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together.*

Learning in math and science involves the same approach. When you're learning new math and science material, you're often given sample problems with worked out solutions. This is because, when you're first trying to understand how to work a problem, you have a heavy cognitive load. So it helps to start out with a work through example. It's like first listening to a song before trying to play the song yourself. Most of the details of the work out solution are right there, and your job is simply to figure out why the steps are taken the way they are. They can help you see the key features, and underline principles of a problem.

This approach is not just a cookie-cutter, just-do-as-you're told, mindless approach when following a worked-out solution. It's more like using a road map to help you when traveling to a new place.

The first step on chunking is simply to **focus your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk.**

If you had the television going on in the background, or you're looking up every few minutes to check or answer your phone or computer messages, it means you're going to have more difficulty in making a chunk, because your brain is not really focusing on chunking the new material.

When you first begin to learn something, you're making new neural patterns and connecting them with preexisting patterns that are spread through many areas of the brain. Your octopus tentacles, so to speak, can't reach very well if some of them are off on other thoughts using up some of the limited slots in your working memory.

The second step in chunking is to understand the basic idea you're trying to chunk, whether it's understanding a concept such as continental drift, seeing the connection between the basic elements of the plot for a story, grasping the economic principle of supply and demand, or comprehending the essence of a particular type of math problem.

> Students can often synthesize the gist, that is figure out the main idea or ideas, pretty naturally. Or at least they can grasp those ideas if they allow the focused and diffuse modes of thinking to take turns in helping them figure out what's going on. **Understanding is like a superglue that helps hold the underlying memory traces together.** It creates broad encompassing traces that can link to other memory traces. *Can you create a chunk if you don't understand? Yes, but it's often a useless chunk that won't fit in with, or relate to other material of your learning.*

Just understanding how a problem was solved does not necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later. Don't confuse the "Aha!", of a breakthrough in understanding, with solid expertise. That's part of why you can grasp an idea when a teacher presents it in class, but if you don't review it fairly soon after you first learned it, it can seem incomprehensible when it comes time to prepare for a test.

In math and science related subjects, closing the book and testing yourself on whether you, yourself, can solve the problem you think you understand, will speed up your learning at this stage. **You often realize the first time you actually understand something is when you can actually do it yourself.**

> Learning takes place in two ways. There's a bottom up chunking process, where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily access it whenever you need to. And there's also a sort of a top down big picture process that allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in.

Doing a rapid two-minute picture walk through a chapter in a book before you begin studying it, glancing at pictures and section headings, can allow you to gain a sense of the big picture. So can listening to a very well organized lecture. These kinds of activities can help you know where to put the chunks you're constructing, how the chunks relate to one another, just like having different groups of puzzle pieces put together separately.

Learn the major concepts or points first. These are often the key parts of a good instructor or book chapter's outline, flow charts, tables, or concept maps. Once you have this done,fill in the details. Even if a few of the puzzle pieces are missing at the end of your studies, you can still see the big picture.

### Illusions of Competence
One of the most common approaches for trying to learn material from a book or from notes is simply to reread it. But psychologist Jeffrey Karpicke has shown that this approach is actually much less productive than another, very simple, technique. Recall. After you've read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you've just read.

Students studied a scientific text and then practiced it, by recalling as much of the information as they could. Then they re-studied the text and recalled it again. That is, they tried to remember the key ideas, once more. The results, in the same amount of time, by simply practising and recalling the material students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach.

When we retrieve knowledge, we're not just being mindless robots. The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning, and helps us to begin forming chunks. It's almost as if the recall process helps build in little neural hooks, that we can hang our thinking on.

Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make your study time more focused and effective. The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading, so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition.

There are four or so slots, in working memory. When you're first learning how to understand a concept, or technique to solve a problem, your entire working memory is involved in the process. As you begin to chunk the concept, you will feel it connecting more easily and smoothly in your mind. Once the concept is chunked, it takes up only one slot in working memory. It simultaneously becomes one smooth strand that's easy to follow, and to use to make new connections.

The rest of your working memory is left clear. That dangling strand of chunked material has, in some sense, increased the amount of information available to your working memory. It's as if the slot in working memory is a hyperlink that's been connected to a great big web page.

Illusions of competence in learning: the reason students like to keep rereading their notes or a textbook is that when they have the book or Google open right in front of them, it provides the illusion that the material is also in their brains. But it's not, because it can be easier to look at the book instead of recalling, students persist in their illusions studying in a way that just isn't very effective.

Just wanting to learn the material, and spending a lot of time with it, doesn't guarantee you'll actually learn it. A super helpful way to make sure you're learning and not fooling yourself with illusions of competence, is to test yourself on whatever you're learning.
In some sense, that's what recall is actually doing. Allowing you to see whether or not you really grasp an idea.

If you make a mistake in what you are doing, it's actually a very good thing. You want to try not to repeat your mistakes, of course, but mistakes are very valuable to make in your little self tests before high stakes real tests. Because they allow you to make repairs and you're thinking flaws bit by bit mistakes help correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and do better.

Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material. When you are learning something new you can often take in subliminal cues for the room and the space around you at the time you were originally learning the material. This can throw you off when you take tests because you often take tests in a room that's different from the room you were learning in. By recalling and thinking about the material when you are in various physical environment, you become independent of the cues from any one given location. That helps you avoid the problem of the test room being different from where you originally learned the material.

### Part two - Seeing the Bigger Picture
### What motivates you?
Learning is hard when you're not into it. But it's way easier when you're learning something you like. And that's why:

Most of the neurons in your cortex carry information about what is happening around you and what you're doing. Neuromodulators are chemicals that influence how a neurons responds to other neurons. There are three important: **Acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin**.

**Acetylcholine neurons form neuromodulatory connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning, when you are paying close attention.** They project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity, leading to new long term memory. Neuromodulators also have a profound impact on your unconscious mind. One of the great brain discoveries in my lifetime has been that our motivation is controlled by a particular chemical substance called Dopamine. Which is found in a small set of neurons in our brain stem.

**Dopamine is released from these neurons, when we receive an unexpected reward.** It's signals project widely and have a very powerful effect on learning. And this is something that also affects decision making. And even the value of sensory inputs.
Dopamine is in the business of predicting future rewards and not just the immediate reward. This can motivate you to do something that may not be rewarding right now but will lead to a much better reward in the future.

Addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity and fool your brain into thinking that something wonderful has just happened.
In fact just the opposite has just happened. This leads to craving and dependence, which can hijack your free will and can motivate actions that are harmful to you.
Loss of Dopamine neurons leads to a lack of motivation. And something called anhedonia, which is a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure.

When you promise to treat yourself something after a study section you are tapping into your dopamine system.

**Serotonin strongly affects your social life. In monkey troops the alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity and the lowest ranking male has the lowest levels.** Prozac, which is prescribed for clinical depression, raises the level of Serotonin activity.

**The level of Serotonin is also closely linked to risk taking behavior. With higher risk in lower Serotonin monkeys.**
Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society.

Finally your emotions strongly affect learning as you are well aware. Emotions were once thought to be separate from cognition but recent research has shown that emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and interact with learning and memory.

The amygdala is part of the limbic system which together with hippocampus is involved in processing memory and decision making as well as regulating emotional reactions. You will want to keep your amygdala happy to be an effective learner.
***

### The value of a library of chunks
What people do to enhance their knowledge and gain expertise is to gradually build the number of chunks in their mind. Valuable bits of information, they can piece together in new and creative ways. Chess masters, for example, can easily access thousands of different chess patterns. The bigger and more well practiced your chunked mental library, whatever the subject you're learning, the more easily you'll be able to solve problems and figure out solutions.

Chunks can also help you understand new concepts. This is because when you grasp one chunk, you'll find that that chunk can be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, not only in that field, but also in very different fields. This idea is called transfer. For example, concepts and problems solving methods you learned for physics can be very similar to chunked concepts in business.

**When you're trying to figure something out, if you have a good library of these chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution by metaphorically speaking, listening to whispers from your diffuse mode. Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novel problems.**

In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize not only a specific concept, but different types and classes of concepts so that you can automatically know how to solve quickly or handle whatever you encounter. You'll start to see patterns that simplify problem solving for you and will soon find that different solution techniques are lurking at the edge of your memory.

There are two ways to figure something out or to solve problems. First there's *sequential step by step reasoning*, and second *through a more holistic intuition*.

**Sequential thinking**, where each **small step** leads deliberately towards a solution, involves the **focused mode**.

**Intuition** on the other hand often seems to **require this creative diffuse mode linking** of several **seemingly different focused mode thoughts**.

Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition, because these new ideas make a leap away from what you're familiar with. Keep in mind that the diffuse mode's semi random way of making connections means that the solutions they provide should be very carefully verified using the focused mode. Intuitive insights aren't always correct.

You may think there are so many problems and concepts, just in a single section or chapter of whatever you're studying, there's just no way to learn them all.

This is where the law of serendipity comes into play. Lady luck favors the one who tries. Just focus on whatever section you're studying. You'll find that once you put that first problem or concept in your mental library, whatever it is, then the second concept will go in a little more easily. And the third more easily still. Not that all of this is a snap, but it does get easier.
***

### Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung and Interleaving

When you're learning a new idea, you sometimes tend to practice it over and over again during the same study session. Continuing to study or practice after you've mastered what you can in the session is called *overlearning*.

Overleaning can have its place. It can produce an automaticity that can be important when you're executing a serve in tennis or a perfect piano concerto. If you choke on tests or public speaking, overlearning can be especially valuable. Did you know that even expert public speakers practice on the order of 70 hours for a typical 20-minute TED Talk? Automaticity can indeed be helpful in times of nervousness, but be wary of repetitive overlearning during a single session. Research has shown it can be a waste of valuable learning time.

Once you've got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn't strengthen the kinds of long term memory connections you want to have strengthened.

> Using a subsequent study session to repeat what you're trying to learn is just fine and often valuable. It can strengthen and deepen your chunked neuron patterns. But be wary; repeating something you already know perfectly well, is, face it, easy. It can also bring the illusion of competence that you've mastered the full range of material, when you've actually only mastered the easy stuff. Instead, you want to balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult. This focusing on the more difficult material is called *deliberate practice*.

All this is also related to a concept known as *Einstellung*.

In this phenomenon, your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern you've already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found. We saw this in the focus pinball picture, where your initial pinball of thought went to the upper part of the brain, but the solution thought pattern was in the lower part.

**The crowded bumpers of the focus mode and the previous patterns you built can create a sort of rut that prevents you from springing to a new place where the solution might be found.** Einstellung means mindset. Basically you can remember einstellung as installing a roadblock because of the way you were initially looking at something. This kind of wrong approach is especially easy to do because sometimes your initial intuition about what's happening or what you need to be doing is misleading. **You have to unlearn your erroneous older ideas or approaches even while you're learning new ones.**

One significant mistake students sometimes make in learning is they blindly start working on homework without reading the text book, attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or even speaking with someone knowledgeable. This is a recipe for sinking. Mastering a new subject means learning not only the basic chunks, but also learning how to select and use different chunks. The best way to learn that is by practicing **jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies.** This is called **interleaving**.

Once you have the basic idea of the technique down during your study session, sort of like learning to ride a bike with training wheels, start interleaving your practice with problems of different types or different types of approaches, concepts, procedures.

Do what you can to mix up your learning. You want your brain to become used to the idea that just knowing how to use a particular concept, approach, or problem-solving technique isn't enough. You also need to know when to use it.

Interleaving your studies, making it a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through problems in the different chapters and materials can sometimes seem to make your learning a little more difficult, but in reality, it helps you learn more deeply.

Interleaving is extraordinarily important. Although practice and repetition is important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it's interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity. It's where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently.

When you interleave within one subject or one discipline, you begin to develop your creative power within that discipline. When you interleave between several subjects or disciplines, you can more easily make interesting new connections between chunks in the different fields, which can enhance your creativity even further.

> Of course it takes time to develop solid chunks of knowledge in different fields, so sometimes there's a trade off. Developing expertise in several fields means you can bring very new ideas from one field to the other, but it can also mean that your expertise in one field or the other isn't quite as deep as that of the person who specializes in only one discipline. On the other hand, if you develop expertise in only one discipline, you may know it very deeply but you may become more deeply entrenched in your familiar way of thinking and not be able to handle new ideas.

Finally, don't make the mistake of thinking that learning only occurs in the kinds of subjects you acquire from teachers or books. When you teach a child how to deal effectively with a bully, or you fix a leaky faucet, or you quickly pack a small suitcase for a business trip to Hong Kong, all of these illustrate the outcomes of important aspects of learning.

### Summary

**Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through use and often through meaning.** You can think of a chunk as a scintillating network of neurons that compactly synthesizes key ideas or actions. Chunks can get bigger and more complex. But at the same time, they're a single easy to access item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory. Chunks are best built with focused, undivided attention, understanding of the basic idea. And practice to help deepen your patterns and to help you gain big picture context.

**Simple recall, trying to remember the key points without looking at the page,** is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along. It seems to help build neural hooks. They help you better understand the material. Also try recalling material in places that are different from where you originally learned the material, so it becomes more deeply ingrained and accessible, regardless of what room you're in. This can be very helpful for tests.

**Transfer is the idea that a chunk you've mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities.** Interleave your learning by practicing your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session. Chunks are very important, but they don't necessarily build flexibility, which is also important in becoming an expert with the material you're learning.

Illusions of competence in learning. **Learn to recognize when you're fooling yourself about whether you're actually learning the material. Test yourself frequently.** Using little mini-tests to see whether you're actually learning the material, or whether you've been fooling yourself, thinking you're learning when you're actually not. Recall is actually a form of mini-testing. Try to avoid depending too much on highlighting, which can fool you into thinking that the material is going into your brain when it actually isn't. Mistakes are a good thing to make when you're learning. They allow you to catch illusions of competence.

Avoid practicing only the easy stuff, which can bring the illusion that you've mastered the material. Deliberately practice what you find more difficult to gain full mastery of the material.

**Einstellung is when your initial thought, an idea you've already had in mind, or a neural pattern you've already developed well and strengthened, prevents a better idea or solution from being found.** Or keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new, better, or more appropriate solutions. The Law of Serendipity is helpful. Lady Luck favors the one who tries. Just pick one tiny thing out to learn, then another.

### Week 3 - Procrastination
### Tackling Procrastination - It's Easier, and More Valuable, Than You Think
The reason that learning to avoid procrastination is so important is that good learning is a bit by bit activity. Avoid cramming which doesn't build solid neural structures, by putting the same amount of time into your learning but spacing that learning out by starting earlier you'll learn better.

Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, willpower is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources. You shouldn't waste willpower on fending off procrastination except when absolutely necessary.


### Zombies Everywhere
Chunking is related to habit. Habit is an energy saver for us. It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities. That's the point of habit, you don't have to think in a focused manner about what you're doing while you're performing the habit. It saves energy.

Habits have four parts:
1. - **The cue.** The trigger that launches you into zombie mode. May be something as simple as seeing the first item in your to do list. Time to start next week's homework. Or seeing a text message from a friend. Time to stop work. A cue by itself is neither helpful or harmful, it's the routine. What we do in reaction to that cue, that's what matters.

2. - **The routine.** This is your zombie mode. The routine habitual response your brain is used to falling into when it receives the cue. Zombie responses can be useful, harmless, or sometimes harmful.

3. - **The reward.** Every habit develops and continues because it rewards us. It gives us an immediate little feeling of pleasure. Procrastination's an easy habit to develop because the reward, moving your mind's focus to something more pleasant, happens so quickly and easily. But good habits can also be rewarded. Finding ways to reward good study habits is important for escaping procrastination.

4. - **The belief.** Habits have power because of your belief in them. For example, you might feel you'll never be able to change your habits of putting off your studies until late in the day. To change a habit, you'll need to change your underlying belief.


### Surf's Up: Process Versus Product
It's perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session. Even when it's a subject you like, it's how you handle those feelings that matters. Nonprocrastinators put their negative thinking aside saying things to themselves like. 'Quit wasting time and just get on with it, once you get going, you'll feel better about it.'

If you find yourself avoiding certain tasks because they make you feel uncomfortable, there's another helpful way to re-frame things. And that's to **learn to focus on process not product.**

**Process means, the flow of time** and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time. As in, I'm going to spend 20 minutes working. **Product is an outcome**, for example, a homework assignment that you need to finish.

To prevent procrastination, avoid concentrating on product. Instead, your attention should be on building processes. Processes relate to simple habits, habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done.

> For example, lets say you don't like doing homework in a particular class. So you put off working on the homework. It's only five questions you think. How hard could that be? Deep down, you realize that answering these five questions could be a very lengthy job. It's easier to live in a fantasy world where the five questions, or the ten page report or whatever, can be done at the last minute. You're challenge is to avoid focusing on the product, the answers to the questions. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead, you need to focus on the process or processes. The small chunks of time you need over days or even weeks to answer the questions or prepare for tests. Who cares whether you finish the homework or grasp the key concepts in any one session. The whole point instead, is that you calmly put forth your best effort for a short period.

One of the easiest ways to focus on process is to focus on doing a Pomodoro, a 25 minute timed work session, not on completing a task. The essential idea here is that the zombie habitual part of your brain likes processes because it can march mindlessly along.

It's far easier to enlist the friendly zombie habit to help with a process, then to help with a product. By focusing on process rather than product, you allow yourself to back away from judging yourself, am I getting closer to finishing? And instead you allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work.


### Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You
Powers of habit to help you avoid procrastination while minimizing your use of willpower. Don't do a full scale change of old habits. Override parts of them and develop a few new ones. The trick to overriding a habit is to look to change your reaction to a cue. The only place you need to apply willpower is to change your reaction to the cue.

**The first one is the cue.** Recognize what launches you in to your zombie procrastination mode. Cues usually fall into one of the four following categories. Location, time, how you feel and reactions. Happens when you look something up on the web and then find yourself web surfing, or a text message disturb your studying taking you 10 minutes to get back into the flow of things.

**Number two, the routine.** Let's say then instead of doing your studies you often divert your attention to something less painful. Your brain wants to automatically go into this routine when you've gotten your cue. So this, is the reaction clue where you must. Actively focus on rewiring your old habit. The key to rewiring is to have a plan. Developing a new ritual can be helpful. Some students make it a habit to leave their phone in their car when they head in for class which removes a potent distraction.  Don't try to change everything at once.

**Number three is the reward.** Why are you procrastinating? Can you substitute an emotional payoff, maybe a feeling of pride for accomplishing something, even if it's small, a sense of satisfaction? Can you win a small internal bet or a contest about something you've turned into a personal game or allow yourself to indulge in a latte or read a favorite web site, provide yourself, maybe, with an evening of mindless television or web surfing without guilt.

Also remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.

**Number four is the belief.** The most important part of changing your procrastination habit is the belief that you can do it. You may find that when the going gets stressful. You long to fall back into old, more comfortable habits. Belief that your new system works is what can get you through.


### Juggling Life and Learning
A good way to keep perspective about what you're trying to learn and accomplish, is to once a week write a brief weekly list of key tasks. Then each day on another page, write a list of the tasks that you can reasonably work on or accomplish.

Try to write this daily task list the evening before. Research has shown that this helps your subconscious to grapple with the tasks on the list so you can figure out how to accomplish them. Writing the list before you go to sleep, enlists your zombies, to help you accomplish the items on the list the next day. If you don't write your tasks down on a list, they lurk at the edge of the four or so slots of your working memory, taking up valuable mental real estate. But once you make a task list, it frees working memory for problem solving.

It is also good to mix different kinds of tasks, like studying a discipline and then go do something physical, like cleaning something.

Try to work on a most important and most disliked task first.


### Diving Deeper into Memory
We have outstanding visual and spacial memory systems that can help form part of our long-term memory. If you were asked to look around a house you never visited before, you'd soon have a sense of the general furniture layout and where the rooms were, color scheme, the pharmaceuticals in the bathroom cupboard. In just a few minutes, your mind would acquire and retain thousands of new pieces of information. Even weeks later, you'd still hold far more in your mind than if you'd spent the same amount of time staring at a blank wall. Your mind is built to retain this kind of general information about a place.

To begin tapping into your visual memory system try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember.  Part of the reason an image is so important to memory is that images connect directly to your right brain's visual spacial centers. The image helps you encapsulate a seemingly humdrum and hard to remember concept by tapping into visual areas with enhanced memory abilities. The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses, the easier it will be for you to recall the concept and what it means.

Repetition's important. Even when you make something memorable, repetition helps get that memorable item firmly lodged into long-term memory. Remember to repeat not a bunch of times in one day but sporadically over several days. Index cards can often be helpful. Writing and saying what you're trying to learn seems to enhance retention.


### What is Long Term Memory?
At the age of 27, HM had an operation for epilepsy that took out his hippocampus on both sides of his brain.

The hippocampus has a shape of a seahorse and is named from the Greek hippos, meaning horse and kampos, meaning sea monster.

The operation was a success. The epilepsy was cured but the price was steep. HM could no longer remember new things. He had become profoundly amnesic. Curiously, you could have a normal conversation with HM, but if you left the room for a few minutes, he could not remember you or what you had discussed.

In the film Memento, the character played by Guy Pearce had this form of amnesia from a concussion.
Note that he tattooed his body with messages, so that he would not forget what he had to do. HM could learn other things, like a new motor skill, but he could not remember having learned it.

Memories are not fixed but living, breathing parts of your brain that are changing all of the time.

Whenever you recall a memory, it changes, a process called, reconsolidation. It is even possible to implant false memories, which are indistinguishable from real ones by simply suggesting and imagining, especially in children who have vivid imaginations.

This is why it is more effective to space learning over time, rather than mass learning all at once. If you want to study something for an hour, you will retain it longer if you spend 10 minutes each month over a semester than an hour on one day.

In contrast, if you wait until the day before an exam to cram the material, you may be able to retrieve for the next day on the exam but it will quickly fade from memory.

In addition to neurons, brains have several types of supporting cells called glial cells. The astrocyte is the most abundant glial cell in the human brain. Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extra cellular ion balance, and are involved with repair following injury.


### Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique
Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. Let's say you wanted to remember four plants that help ward off vampires. Garlic, rose, hawthorn and mustard. The first letters abbreviate to GRHM, so all you need to do to remember is use the image of a graham cracker.

Many disciplines use memorable sentences to help students memorize concepts. The first letter of each word in the sentence is also the first letter of each word in a list that needs to be memorized.

The memory palace technique is a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember. It involves calling to mind a familiar place. Like the layout of your house, and using it as a sort of a visual notepad where you can deposit the concept images that you want to remember. All you have to do is call to mind the place you're familiar with. Your home, your route to school, or your favorite restaurant.

> The memory palace technique is useful for remembering unrelated items, such as a grocery list. Milk, bread, eggs. To use the technique, you might imagine a gigantic bottle of milk just inside your front door. The bread plopped on the couch and a cracked egg dribbling off the edge of the coffee table. In other words, you'd imagine yourself walking through a place you know well, coupled with shockingly memorable images of what you want to remember.

### Week 4 - Renaissance Learning  and Unlocking Your Potential I
### How to Become a Better Learner

Tip number one, the best gift that you can give your brain is Physical Exercise. We once thought that all of the neurons in your brain were already present at birth, but we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day.

There are certain critical periods in the development of your brain. When sudden improvements occur in specific abilities, expect them to happen and prepare your brain for them. The critical period for first language acquisition extends up to puberty. One of the best studied critical periods in the brain is when binocular depth perception or stereopsis matures during the first two years of life.


### Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy

One of the best things you can do to not only remember, but understand concepts, is to create a metaphor or analogy for them. Often the more visual the better. A metaphor is just a way of realizing that one thing is somehow similar to another.

It's often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you're trying to understand.

Put yourself in an electron's warm and fuzzy slippers as it burrows through a slab of copper. Or sneak inside the X of an algebraic equation and feel what it's like to poke your head out of the rabbit hole. But just don't let it get exploded by an inadvertent divide by zero. In chemistry, compare a cation with a cat that has paws and is therefore pawsitive. And an anion with an onion that's negative, because it makes you cry.


### No Need for Genius Envy
This is a good place for us to step back and look again at chunking from another perspective.

Notice what we're doing here. We're interleaving our learning by jumping back to revisit and deepen our understanding of a topic we've already covered. There's an interesting connection between learning math and science and learning a sport.

In baseball, for example, you don't learn how to hit in one day. Instead, your body perfects your swing from lots and lots of repetition over a period of years. Smooth repetition creates muscle memory, so your body knows what to do from a single thought. One chunk instead of having to recall all the complex steps involved in hitting a ball.

At some point you just know it from memory. For example you memorize the idea that you simply add exponents, those little superscript numbers, when you are multiplying numbers that have the same base. Ten to the fourth times ten to the fifth is equal to ten to the ninth.

Chess masters, emergency room physicians, fighter pilots, and many other experts often have to make complex decisions rapidly. They shut down their conscious system and instead rely on their well trained intuition, drawing on their deeply ingrained repertoire of chunks.

At some point self-consciously understanding why you do what you do, just slows you down and interrupts the flow resulting in worse decisions. But wait, are chess masters and people who can multiply six digit numbers in their heads exceptionally gifted? Not necessarily.

Intelligence matters. Being smarter often equates to having a larger working memory. Your hot rod of a memory may be able to hold nine things in mind instead of four and you can latch on to those things like a bulldog, which makes it easier to learn. But guess what, it also makes it more difficult for you to be creative.

How's that? It's our old friend and enemy Einstellung. The idea you are already holding in mind can block you from fresh thoughts. A superb working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts can't easily peek through.

If you're one of those people who can't hold a lot in mind at once, you lose focus and start daydreaming in lectures and have to get to some place quiet to focus so you can use your working memory to its maximum, well welcome to the clan of the creative. Having a somewhat smaller working memory means you can more easily generalize your learning into new, more creative combinations.

Because your working memory, which grows from the focusing abilities of the prefrontal cortex doesn't lock everything up so tightly, you can more easily get input from other parts of your brain. These other areas, which include the sensory cortex, not only are more in tune with what's going on around you in the environment, but are also the source of dreams, not to mention creative ideas.

You may have to work harder sometimes or even much of the time to understand what's going on. But once you get something chunked you can take that chunk and turn it outside in and inside round, putting it through creative paces even you didn't think you were capable of. Here's another point to put into your mental chunker.


### The Value of Teamwork
There's a great deal of evidence from research that the right hemisphere helps us step back and put our work into big picture perspective. People with damage to the right hemisphere are often unable to gain ah-ha, insights. The right hemisphere, as it turns out, is vitally important in getting into the right track and doing reality checks.

When you're absolutely certain that what you've done on a homework or test is fine, be aware that this feeling may be based on overly confident perspectives arising in part from the left hemisphere. When you step back and recheck, you're allowing for more interaction between the hemispheres, taking advantage of the special perspectives and abilities of each.

Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman perhaps said it best when he pointed out, the first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool. One of the best ways to catch your blind spots and errors is to brainstorm and work with others who are also smartly focused on the topic.


### A Test Checklist
We've mentioned it earlier, but it's worth repeating. Testing is itself an extraordinarily powerful, learning experience. This means that the effort you put into test-taking, including the preliminary mini test of your recall and your ability to problem solve during your preparation is of fundamental importance. If you compare how much you learn by spending one hour studying, versus one hour taking a test on that same material, you'll retain and learn far more as a result of the hour you spent taking a test. Testing, it seems, has a wonderful way of concentrating the mind.

- Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? Just hunting for relevent worked-out examples doesn't count.
- Did you work with classmates on homework problems or at least check your solutions with others? Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution before working with classmates?
- Did you participate actively in homework group discussions contributing ideas and asking questions? Did you consult with the instructor or teaching assistants when you were having trouble with something?
- Did you understand all your homework problem solutions when they were handed in? Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that weren't clear to you? If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you could do everything on it? Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time on the Algebra in calculations?
- Did you go over the study guide and problems with class mates and quiz one another? If there was a review session before the test, did you attended and asked questions about anything you weren't sure about?
- And lastly, did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test? If your answer is no, your answers to all the preceding questions may not matter.


### Hard Start -> Jump to Easy
The classic way students are taught to approach tests is to tackle the easiest problems first. This is based on the idea that by the time you finish the relatively simple problems, you'll be confident in handling the more difficult. This approach works for some people, mostly because, well, anything works for some people. Unfortunately, however, for many people it's counterproductive. Tough problems often need lots of time, meaning you'd want to start on them first thing on the test. Difficult problems can also scream for the creative powers of the diffuse mode. But to access the diffuse mode, you need to not be focusing on what you so badly want to solve.

What to do? Easy problems first, or hard? The answer is to start with the hard problems but quickly jump to the easy ones.

When the test is first handed out to you, first take a quick look to get a sense of what it involves. You should do this in any case.

Then, when you start working the problems, start first with what appears to be the hardest problem. But steel yourself to pull away within the first minute or two, if you get stuck or you get a sense that you might not be on the right track.

This does something exceptionally helpful. Starting hard loads the first most difficult problem in mind and then switches attention away from it. Both these activities are what allow the diffuse mode to begin its work. If your initial work on the first hard problem has unsettled you, turn next to an easy problem. And complete or do as much as you can. Then move, next, to another difficult looking problem and try to make a bit of progress. Again, change to something easier as soon as you feel yourself getting bogged down or stuck.

When you return to the more difficult problems, you'll often be pleased that the next step or steps in the problem will seem to be more obvious to you. You may not be able to get all the way to the end immediately, but at least you can get further before you switch to something else of which you can make progress.

The hard start jump to easy technique may make more efficient use of your brain by allowing different parts of the brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts. Using the hard start jump to easy technique on tests guarantees that you will have at least a little work done on every problem. It's also a valuable technique for helping you avoid Einstellung, getting stuck on the wrong approach - because you have a chance to look at the problem from differing perspectives.

This may be why test takers sometimes find that the solution pops to mind right as they walk out the door. When they give up, their attention switched, allowing the diffuse mode the tiny bit of traction it needed to go to work and return the solution.
